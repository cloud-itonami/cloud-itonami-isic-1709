  "Drives the real OperationActor StateGraph through a scenario built
  directly from `paperarticles.store/sample-data!`'s seed and
  `paperarticles.governor`'s actual rules (this repo's own
  `paperarticles.sim` was run and cross-checked against
  `paperarticles.store`'s real seed ids and `paperarticles.governor`'s
  real rule names before this namespace was written -- every id/op/rule
  name below is verified real, none invented; this mirrors
  `paperarticles.sim`'s scenario rather than calling its `-main`
  directly, to keep this namespace's demo self-contained and its output
  free of `println` noise):

    1. `:log-production-batch` batch-001 with a clean grade patch --
       `paperarticles.phase`'s ONLY phase-3 auto-eligible op,
       governor-clean -> auto-commits, no human involved.
    2. `:schedule-maintenance` mnt-1 on equip-001 (verified+registered
       pulp-molding-press) -- clean, but `:schedule-maintenance` is
       never a member of any phase's `:auto` set (see
       `paperarticles.phase` ns docstring) -> escalates -> human
       approval -> commit.
    3. `:flag-safety-concern` concern-1 on equip-001 -- proposal stake
       `:coordination/safety-concern` is the one member of
       `paperarticles.governor/high-stakes`, so this ALWAYS escalates
       regardless of confidence or phase -> human plant-supervisor
       approval -> commit.
    4. `:coordinate-shipment` ship-1 on batch-001, 500.0 units (well
       within batch-001's own recorded 5000.0 units vs 1000.0 already
       shipped) -- clean, but `:coordinate-shipment` is likewise never
       auto-eligible at phase 3 -> escalates -> human approval ->
       commit.

    Then four DISTINCT HARD-hold scenarios, each independently
    re-derived by the governor from the store's own ground-truth
    fields -- none ever reaches a human:

    5. `:schedule-maintenance` mnt-2 on equip-002 -- equip-002 is
       seeded `:verified? false :registered? false` (an
       UNVERIFIED/unregistered die-cutter unit) -> HARD hold, rule
       `:equipment-not-verified`.
    6. `:coordinate-shipment` ship-2 on batch-003 -- batch-003 is
       seeded `:verified? false :registered? false` -> HARD hold, rule
       `:batch-not-verified`.
    7. `:coordinate-shipment` ship-3 on batch-002, 100.0 units --
       batch-002's own recorded quantity is 800.0 and its own recorded
       `:shipped-quantity-units` is already 750.0, so 750.0+100.0 >
       800.0 -> HARD hold, rule `:shipment-quantity-exceeded`.
    8. `:log-production-batch` batch-001 with fabricated grade
       `:premium-plus-select` -> HARD hold, rule `:invalid-grade`.

  Returns the seeded `db` (a `paperarticles.store/MemStore`) after the
  run, so `render` can read every value straight off it."
