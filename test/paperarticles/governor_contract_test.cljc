  "The governor contract as executable tests -- this vertical's own
  scope boundary ('does NOT control converting-line equipment
  directly') implemented faithfully. The single invariant under test:

    PaperArticlesAdvisor never schedules maintenance, flags a safety
    concern, or coordinates a shipment the Paper Articles Plant
    Operations Governor would reject; `:schedule-maintenance`/
    `:flag-safety-concern`/`:coordinate-shipment` NEVER auto-commit at
    any phase; `:log-production-batch` (no physical risk) MAY
    auto-commit when clean; and every decision (commit OR hold) leaves
    exactly one ledger fact."
